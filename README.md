# üòÅüò∂‚òπÔ∏èSentiment Analysis Tool

This Streamlit application is a versatile **Sentiment Analysis Tool** that allows users to analyze the emotional tone of text. You can input text directly, fetch content from a URL, or upload a file (`.txt` or `.csv`). The application provides two powerful analysis engines: **VADER** for fast, rule-based analysis and a **Transformer model** for more accurate, context-aware analysis.

## Features

  - **Multiple Input Methods**: Analyze text from three sources:
      - **Raw Text**: Paste any text directly into the text area.
      - **URL**: Provide a URL to scrape text content from a webpage.
      - **File Upload**: Upload `.txt` or `.csv` files for analysis.
  - **Two Analysis Engines**: Choose the best tool for your needs:
      - **VADER**: A fast, lexicon-based model great for quick analysis of social media text.
      - **Transformer**: A more accurate, deep-learning model (based on `cardiffnlp/twitter-roberta-base-sentiment-latest`) that understands nuances and context.
  - **Detailed Results**: Get a breakdown of sentiment percentages (Positive, Neutral, Negative) and an overall sentiment classification.
  - **Interactive Visualization**: The results are presented in a clear, easy-to-read bar chart.
